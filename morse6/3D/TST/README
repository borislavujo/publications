Dynamical properties of two- and three-dimensional colloidal clusters
B. Faƒçkovec and J. W. R. Morgan and D. J. Wales

This document describes the steps necessary to generate a Morse database and calculate the TST rates as described in the paper.
Requirements: an up-to-date Linux distribution, with python and a fortran compiler

Step 1: Download and compile the software
GMIN, OPTIM and PATHSAMPLE can be downloaded from http://www-wales.ch.cam.ac.uk/svn.tar.bz2
Unpack the tarball and compile the three programs, the steps for each are the same:
1. Change to the directory of the program.
2. Create a folder called build/ and change to it.
3. Run
 $ cmake ../source/
   to generate the Makefiles. Cmake will attempt to find a fortran compiler. The compiler can be specified manually, for example
 $ FC=gfortran cmake ../source/
4. Run
 $ ccmake .
   to adjust compiler options.
5. Run
 $ make
   to build the program.
The binaries now exist in the build directory, eg. /path/to/tarball/wales/GMIN/build/GMIN Make sure they are in your PATH, by for example moving the binaries to a directory in your PATH or linking them from such a directory.

Step 2: Generate data
Two templates are provided: 2Dtemplate.tar.bz2 and 3Dtemplate.tar.bz2 for 2D and 3D clusters respectively.
1. Unpack the tarball and cd into the created directory. There will be 3 subdirectories: gmin, optim and pathsample.
2. Run 
 $ find . -type f -exec sed -i "s/NO_OF_ATOMS/<n>/g" \{\} \;
   where <n> is replaced by the number of particles in the cluster you wish to use.
3. cd to gmin/ and run
 $ ./run_gmin.sh
   GMIN will be run three times from random starting points to generate a list of low-lying potential energy minima.
4. Run
 $ ./extractmin.sh
   The minima will be copied across to optim/ in the correct format
5. cd to optim/ and run
 $ ./connectall.sh
   Connections will be attempted between all pairs of minima.
6. Run
 $ ./connectall.sh
 $ cp path.info.all ../pathsample/path.info.all
   All the pathways will be placed in a single file in the correct format to seed a PATHSAMPLE database
7. cd to pathsample/ and run
 $ cp pathdata.template.STARTFROMPATH pathdata
 $ PATHSAMPLE
   The PATHSAMPLE database will be created
   If the final lines of output are an error such as
     At line 231 of file /home/jwrm2/svn/PATHSAMPLE/source/getallpaths.f (unit = 1, file = 'path.info')
     Fortran runtime error: Bad real number in item 15 of list input
   Check whether the files min.A and min.B exist. If they do not, run
 $ echo -e "1\n1" > min.A
 $ echo -e "1\n2" > min.B
8. The database should be expanded until no new minima or transition states can be found. A sample pathdata file is provided in pathdata.template.NEWCONNECTIONS
   See http://www-wales.ch.cam.ac.uk/PATHSAMPLE.2.1.doc/PATHSAMPLE.html for full details
9. Rate constants between all pairs of minima by be generated by running
 $ ./rates.sh
10. Free energies are calculated by adjusting the TEMPERATURE in pathdata.template.REGROUPFREE and running
 $ cp pathdata.template.REGROUPFREE pathdata
 $ PATHSAMPLE
